    chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
    junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and
    the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia.
    Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may
    be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult
    female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
    Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
    meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting,
    which is still practiced in some places.
